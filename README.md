# 999-00003-A: OBC Requirements Document

Halo Car Inc uses a modified [US government design review process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_review_(U.S._government)) to design, fabricate, and distribute the  Kia Niro (KN) Series of cars.  This will aid in keeping the product within budget, on time, and limit requirement creep. All tasks and timelines will be tracked using [Linear](https://linear.app/halocar), Fusion 360 3D CAD models [Cloud Team Server](https://halo5.autodesk360.com/g/all_projects/active), business data stored in an organized [Halo_ALL](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AKq4yLznZ1RzUk9PVA) Google Drive folder, and ALL other engineering data stored in multiple [Halo Hardware Github](https://github.com/orgs/urbanrobo/teams/hardware/repositories) repos.

**Future cars like Chevy Bolt and Tesla Model 3 shall only follow these requirements, if specifically called out in this document.**

## 1.0 Mission Concept Review (MCR)
See [Halo Pitch Deck](???) and [999-00001-A Kira Niro System Architecture Requirements Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RNme7q0ufrCDHNyr7VOxuHKhVUad4LDPr4K3CM-rN78/edit) 

Objectives:
1. Allow any EV with ISO 11898-2 high-speed CAN Bus interface (1 Mbit/s on CAN, 5 Mbit/s on CAN-FD) to be remote piloted via 5G cellular.
2. Create rental fleet of 10 vehicles by April 15 that can be resold to dealerships for < $2k in repairs
3. ???                                                                                                                                           

Concepts to meet Objectives:
1. Analog man in the middle attack and digital CAN Bus reverse engineering. 
2. All additions must limit holes put into vehicle and not damage paint in all way.
3. ???
